# CSE Cracks -- A Course for Filling in the Missing Cracks in CSE Curriculums

The CSE Cracks course tries to fill some of the gaps in tooling and knowledge present in most CSE curriculums.
This course is inspired by (and in no way a replacement for) [MIT's Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

Additionally, this repository serves as an example for courses that use the [autograder](https://github.com/eriq-augustine/autograder-server) system.
