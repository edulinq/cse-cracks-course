    "# Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (also called \"regexp\" or \"regex\") are patterns that let you find matching text.\n",
    "Think of them like mathematical expressions for text (an equation can define a line (collection of points), and a regex can define a collection of strings).\n",
    "When starting off, regular expressions can be pretty confusing.\n",
    "But once you get comfortable using them, you start to see how they can be used in almost all of your everyday coding.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be using Python for this exercise (hence the iPython notebook),\n",
    "so we will be using the `re` Python standard library.\n",
    "Almost every major programming language has regular expressions either built-in or supported in a standard library.\n",
    "There may be slight variations in the syntax and semantics from language to language,\n",
    "but the core functionality will all be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Normal\" Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple regular expressions can be used to match strings in the same way that you would use another string to match a string\n",
    "(like if you were using [`str.find()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find) or [`str.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace).\n",
    "Just type the characters that you want to match.\n",

    "## Character Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Character classes allow us to refer to any character inside of a set of characters.\n",
    "Most regex language/engines will have built-in character classes,\n",
    "and also the ability to define custom character classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digits\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in digit character class is `\\d`, and will match any digit (0-9).\n",
    "The inverse class (not a digit) is also available using `\\D`.\n",
    "`\\d` and `\\D` do not overlap and together match everything,\n",
    "this will be true for all the character classes we will cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Word\" Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Word\" characters are `a-z`, `A-Z` and `_` (underscore),\n",
    "and are all included in the \"word\" character class: `\\w`.\n",
    "Like the digit character class, you can get the inverse class (not a word) using `\\W`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Whitespace\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a character class to match whitespace: `\\s`.\n",
    "Whitespace in this context includes characters like spaces, tabs, newlines, carrige returns, etc.\n",
    "The inserve class (not whitespace) is availble as `\\S`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Any Character\n",
    "\n",
    "You can represent (almost) any character using the `.` (dot) character classs.\n",
    "This will match anything except newlines (you have to enable a special option for that behavior).\n",
    "To make a literal period, you would need to escape it `\\.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Character Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create your own custom character class using square brackets: `[]`.\n",
    "Any characters inside the square brackets are now inside the character class.\n",
    "So `[abc]` will match any character that is an 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can invert a custom character class by having a carrot/hat character directly after the opening square bracket.\n",
    "So `[^abc]` will match any character that is **not** an 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n",
    "To match a literal carrot/hat, you can escape it: `[abc\\^]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a dash `-` to represent a range of characters.\n",
    "You can make a range between lowercase characters `[a-z]`, uppercase characters `[A-Z]`, and digits `[0-9]`.\n",
    "Note that you cannot range between lowercase and uppercasse characters.\n",
    "To match a literal dash, you can escape it.\n",
    "For example, `[a-z]` matches 'a' *through* 'z', but `[a\\-z]` matches 'a', 'z', or '-'.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can recreate some of our built-in character classes using the custom character class:\n",
    " - `\\d` == `[0-9]`\n",
    " - `\\D` == `[^0-9]`\n",
    " - `\\w` == `[a-zA-Z]`\n",
    " - `\\W` == `[^a-zA-Z]`\n",
    " - `\\s` == `[ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]`\n",
    " - `\\S` == `[^ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]`"
