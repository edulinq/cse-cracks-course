    "[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (also called \"regexp\" or \"regex\") are patterns that let you find matching text.\n",
    "Think of them like mathematical expressions for text (an equation can define a line (collection of points), and a regex can define a collection of strings).\n",
    "When starting off, regular expressions can be pretty confusing.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be using Python for this exercise (hence the iPython notebook),\n",
    "so we will be using the `re` Python standard library.\n",
    "Almost every major programming language has regular expressions either built-in or supported in a standard library.\n",
    "There may be slight variations in the syntax and semantics from language to language,\n",
    "but the core functionality will all be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In code and documentation, we will often refer to a regex as a \"pattern\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Normal\" Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple regular expressions can be used to match strings in the same way that you would use another string to match a string\n",
    "(like if you were using [`str.find()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find) or [`str.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace).\n",
    "Just type the characters that you want to match.\n",

    "When writing regular expressions in Python, you will probably want to use a [\"raw string\"](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#escape-sequences).\n",
    "Raw strings do not interpret escape characters, so you don't have to double escape backslashes or accidentally create escape characters."
