    "[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (also called \"regexp\" or \"regex\") are patterns that let you find matching text.\n",
    "Think of them like mathematical expressions for text (an equation can define a line (collection of points), and a regex can define a collection of strings).\n",
    "When starting off, regular expressions can be pretty confusing.\n",

    "We will be using Python for this exercise (hence the iPython notebook),\n",
    "so we will be using the `re` Python standard library.\n",
    "Almost every major programming language has regular expressions either built-in or supported in a standard library.\n",
    "There may be slight variations in the syntax and semantics from language to language,\n",
    "but the core functionality will all be the same.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### \"Normal\" Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple regular expressions can be used to match strings in the same way that you would use another string to match a string\n",
    "(like if you were using [`str.find()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find) or [`str.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace).\n",
    "Just type the characters that you want to match.\n",

    "When writing regular expressions in Python, you will probably want to use a [\"raw string\"](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#escape-sequences).\n",
    "Raw strings do not interpret escape characters, so you don't have to double escape backslashes or accidentally create escape characters."
