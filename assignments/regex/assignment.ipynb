    "# Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (also called \"regexp\" or \"regex\") are patterns that let you find matching text.\n",
    "Think of them like mathematical expressions for text (an equation can define a line (collection of points), and a regex can define a collection of strings).\n",
    "When starting off, regular expressions can be pretty confusing.\n",
    "But once you get comfortable using them, you start to see how they can be used in almost all of your everyday coding.\n",

    "## Regular Expressions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Python for this exercise (hence the iPython notebook),\n",
    "so we will be using the `re` Python standard library.\n",
    "Almost every major programming language has regular expressions either built-in or supported in a standard library.\n",
    "There may be slight variations in the syntax and semantics from language to language,\n",
    "but the core functionality will all be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In code and documentation, we will often refer to a regex as a \"pattern\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### re.search()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment (and probably most of your Python regex usage),\n",
    "we will be using the method `re.search()`.\n",
    "`re.search()` takes two required arguments,\n",
    "first the regex and then the string to search in.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another method `re.match()` that is subtly different,\n",
    "and you will probably want to avoid.\n",
    "`re.search()` looks for a match within a string (and it can be the entire string).\n",
    "`re.match()` tries to match **the entire** string.\n",
    "Latter in this assignment, we will discuss how to recreate the functionality of `re.match()`\n",
    "in a more explicit and less error-pone way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Normal\" Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple regular expressions can be used to match strings in the same way that you would use another string to match a string\n",
    "(like if you were using [`str.find()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find) or [`str.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace).\n",
    "Just type the characters that you want to match.\n",
    "In fact, in Python strings are used to represent regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the string `\"foo\"` can be used as a regular expression to match \"foo\", \"food\", \"foo bar\", and literally infinite other strings."
