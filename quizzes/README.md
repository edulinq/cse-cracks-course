# Quizzes

This directory contains quizzes (Canvas and paper) for CSE Cracks course.
These quizzes serve the dual purposes of being real educating tools,
and being samples for using the [Quiz Generator](https://github.com/eriq-augustine/quizgen).

These quizzes are created in a neutral Markdown-like format that can be converted to
Canvas quizzes, raw HTML quizzes (using form submission), and GradeScope-compatible Tex/PDF quizzes.
Keeping quizzes in a textual format like this has the advantage of working well with source control
and allowing "write-once" quizzes that do not need to be re-written for different formats.
Additionally, the quiz generator tool can be run during CI to verify that all quizzes parse and generate properly.

For a list of useful commands, see the [Quiz Generator Documentation](https://github.com/edulinq/quizgen?tab=readme-ov-file#quiz-generator).
